# What is the pipeline

```
GIS data is collected (how) -> GIS data is stored (does it need tidying) -> GIS data is analyzed -> what kinds of GIS papers, what kinds of questions are answered
```

## Geospatial Analysis Systems - experience requirements

* ArcGIS for Desktop
* ArcGIS for server in a multi-user SDE environment
* Programming languages: Python / Visual Basic / C+
* ESRI software
* Interprets and applies information from a number of sources into the GIS, including engineering plans, floodplain maps, as-built plans, surveys, plats, tabular reports, field observation, satellite imagery, aerial photographs, existing maps and AutoCAD datasets, using the principles of cartography including; coordinate systems, longitude, latitude, elevation, topography, and map scales; consults appropriate internal staff and/or originator to ensure accurate interpretation of information.Â· Responds to inquiries regarding GIS Data, records and mapping information; identifies, compiles, and generates specific maps given situational requests for assigned projects. Analyzes results to tailor applications for individual users or departments.
* Space-based sensors and/or satellite ground control segments 
* Remote sensing
* Experience utilizing GPS and data collectors
* Experience with GIS and ESRI software
* Experience with AutoCAD
* R packages: [gmap](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dismo/versions/1.1-4/topics/gmap), [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/sp.pdf), [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html), [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/vignettes/combine_maptools.pdf)

## Datasets

* https://gisgeography.com/best-free-gis-data-sources-raster-vector/
* ShapeFiles : https://mangomap.com/gis-data

[Shapefiles were developed by ESRI](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000280.shtml) (Environmental Systems Research Institute) and published in 1998 ([ESRI White Paper, 1998](https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf)):
Shapefiles are composed of:

* Main file (*.shp)
* index file (*.shx)
* dBase Table (*DBF)
